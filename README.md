# overview

my personal collection of nvim shiz. this is all lua oriented in nature and is
only applicable to nvim.  all modules are managed and installed by `Packer`.

all of this should reside in `${HOME}/.config/nvim`.  

on first run, this will attempted to pull down all of the interesting elements
from github and install the necessary packages.
